\section{Client Pull Architecture}
Our message passing system is built as a hierarchy. We use a top-level
\emph{Olympics} class for organization.  This class communicates with
5 \emph{actors}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{TeamRoster} - The \emph{TeamRoster} is able to send
    messages to a number of \emph{Team} classes. When the
    \emph{TeamRoster} receives a message containing a particular team
    name, it sends a message to the relevant \emph{Team}.
  \item \textbf{EventRoster} - The \emph{EventRoster} is very similar
    to the \emph{TeamRoster}: the \emph{EventRoster} is also able to
    communicate with a number \emph{Event} classes; when it receives a
    message containing a particular event type, it sends that message
    to the relevant \emph{Event}.
  \item \textbf{TabletRequestRouter} - The \emph{TabletRequestRouter}
    serves as a router that helps spread client request to various
    workers.  When it receives a message, it distributes the message,
    using a round robin schedule, to one of many \emph{TabletRequestWorker}.
  \item \textbf{CacofonixListener} - The \emph{CacofonixListener} is
    very similar to the \emph{TabletRequestRouter}: when it receives a
    message, it determines whether that message is a
    \emph{TeamMessage} or an \emph{EventMessage} and sends that
    message to the relevant actors.
  \item \textbf{EventSubscription} -
\end{itemize}

\section{Softeware}
We've built our system on top of the Scala (Akka) \emph{actors}
library.  This library provides a message passing hierarcical
architecture for the scala programming language.
